**On-device audio transcription and AI insights for Android**

HearoPilot combines a local Speech-to-Text engine with a local Large Language Model to deliver
real-time transcription and AI-generated insights — entirely offline, with no data sent to any
server.

---

## Features

- **Real-time transcription** — streaming STT via Sherpa-ONNX (NeMo Parakeet TDT 0.6B Int8)
- **On-device AI insights** — contextual analysis via llama.cpp (Gemma 3 1B, Q8_0 / IQ4_NL)
- **100% offline** — privacy-first; no network calls during recording
- **Four recording modes** — Simple Listening, Short Meeting, Long Meeting, Real-Time Translation
- **25 UI languages** — full i18n including localized LLM system prompts
- **Global search** — full-text search across all transcriptions, AI insights and session names, with highlighted snippets and 300 ms debounce
- **Session management** — persistent sessions with rename, history, and segment detail view
- **Inline editing** — edit transcription segments, AI insight content, and individual tasks directly from session history
- **Post-stop UX** — stop button immediately shows a frozen Mic icon with a spinner while the final AI insight is being generated; back navigation is blocked until finalization completes
- **Recording timer** — live elapsed time with hours support (`h:mm:ss`)
- **Screen-off recording** — Foreground Service keeps recording when the display is off
- **Resumable downloads** — partial-file resume for both STT and LLM models
- **Dark mode** — full Material Design 3 support
- **Release-optimized** — R8 full-mode shrinking + ProGuard rules

## Recording Modes

| Mode | Description | AI Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| **Simple Listening** | Lightweight transcription | Final summary only |
| **Short Meeting** | Brief focused meetings | Summary + tasks + suggestions, high frequency |
| **Long Meeting** | Extended conferences, many speakers | Summary + tasks + suggestions, low frequency |
| **Real-Time Translation** | Translate speech as you speak | Raw segment translation, no analysis wrapper |

---

## Architecture

The project follows **Clean Architecture** with a strict dependency rule:

```
UI (app) → Presentation → Domain ← Data
```

No outer layer may import from an inner layer's implementation; only interfaces cross boundaries.

```

### Key Design Decisions

- **`SupportedLanguages.ALL`** — single source of truth for the 25 language list used in UI,
  LLM prompt substitution, and future locale logic
- **`ModelConfig` / `DefaultModelConfig`** — all model URLs and filenames in one place; no
  scattered constants across download infrastructure
- **`AppIcons`** — centralized icon object; all icon references go through it
- **Prompt architecture** — system prompts live in `strings.xml` (`prompt_simple_listening`,
  `prompt_short_meeting`, `prompt_long_meeting`, `prompt_translation`); loaded at startup and
  stored in DataStore; translated in full for all 25 locales
- **KV cache reuse** — `setSystemPrompt` is called once per session; subsequent inference calls
  reuse the cached prefix instead of re-encoding the system prompt every time
- **Stateless LLM inference** — context is rebuilt per call from accumulated segments; this
  prevents unbounded context growth and allows clean mode switches

## AI Models

| Role | Model | Size |
|---|---|---|
| **STT** | NeMo Parakeet TDT 0.6B Int8 (Sherpa-ONNX) | ~670 MB (3 ONNX files + tokens.txt) |
| **LLM — Q8\_0** | Gemma 3 1B Q8\_0 (llama.cpp GGUF) | ~1 GB |
| **LLM — IQ4\_NL** | Gemma 3 1B IQ4\_NL (llama.cpp GGUF) | ~650 MB |
| **LLM — Qwen 3.5 (beta)** | Qwen 3.5 0.8B Q8\_0 (llama.cpp GGUF) | ~870 MB |

The two Gemma variants use the same model; Q8\_0 offers higher output quality while IQ4\_NL is more
efficient on mid-range devices. The app automatically recommends the best Gemma variant based on
device RAM and Android version:

| Device condition | Recommended variant |
|---|---|
| RAM > 8 GB **and** Android 14+ (API 34+) | Q8\_0 |
| Otherwise | IQ4\_NL |

The recommended variant is downloaded automatically during onboarding. Both Gemma variants can be
kept on disk simultaneously and switched instantly from Settings without re-downloading.

> **Qwen 3.5 0.8B (beta)** is an alternative model architecture available as an experimental,
> manual-only download in Settings. It is never recommended automatically by device-tier detection
> and is intended for advanced users who want to compare model behaviour.

Models are stored in app-specific storage (`getExternalFilesDir()`).
Downloads resume automatically from partial files on retry.

## STT Pipeline

```
AudioRecord (16 kHz mono, PCM 16-bit, AudioSource.MIC)
  → recording thread at THREAD_PRIORITY_URGENT_AUDIO
  → 100 ms read chunks → FloatArray SampleBuffer (GC-free, doubling growth)
  → VAD window loop (512-sample windows)
      ├─ speech detected → include 0.4 s lookback (6400 samples)
      └─ end of segment → final inference on full VAD buffer
  → partial inference gate:
      ├─ ≥ 200 ms elapsed since last call
      └─ ≥ 1.5 s (24000 samples) of new audio since last call
  → Parakeet TDT inference (capped at 30 s / 480000 samples per call)
  → .trim() → TranscriptionSegment (isComplete = false | true)
  → on segment end: carry over 3 s (48000 samples) of audio as context for next segment
```

### VAD / Audio Optimizations

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `AudioSource.MIC` | — | Delivers raw PCM; `VOICE_RECOGNITION` activates HAL noise reduction on some devices (e.g. OnePlus) that degrades transducer accuracy |
| Recording thread priority | `URGENT_AUDIO` | Prevents audio buffer drops under CPU load |
| ADPF hint (VAD/ASR thread) | 50 ms target | Signals scheduler to prefer big cores on big.LITTLE SoCs; prevents ASR parking on efficiency cores |
| VAD window size | 512 samples | Standard Silero-VAD frame size |
| Speech lookback | 6400 samples (0.4 s) | Captures word beginnings that precede the VAD trigger |
| Min new audio gate | 24000 samples (1.5 s) | Offline Parakeet needs sufficient audio context per call for consistent accuracy, regardless of device speed |
| Partial inference cap | 480000 samples (30 s) | Without this cap, inference time grows O(n²) for long segments (60 s segment → 9 s+ inference per call) |
| Context carry-over | 48000 samples (3 s) | Keeps acoustic context after a silence gap; model doesn't restart cold |
| Initial buffer capacity | 160000 samples (~10 s) | Pre-allocated to avoid early resizes during the first segment |
| Audio buffer multiplier | 4× `minBufferSize` | Absorbs scheduling jitter; reduces probability of `AudioRecord` overrun |
| VAD configurable params | threshold, min silence, max speech | Exposed in Settings, persisted in DataStore |
| `.trim()` on output | — | Parakeet tokenizer prepends a leading space to every transcription |
| GC-free `SampleBuffer` | `FloatArray` + doubling | Eliminates `Float` boxing overhead and GC pauses from `ArrayList<Float>` |

---

## LLM Pipeline

```
TranscriptionSegments (accumulated in rolling buffer, last 3 complete segments)
  → SyncSttLlmUseCase
      ├─ mode-specific system prompt (from strings.xml, stored in DataStore)
      ├─ analysis modes: "Context: <rolling> \n\n Analyze: <new content>"
      └─ translation mode: raw text only (no wrapper — prevents small-model echoing)
  → min-word gate (≥ 5 new words, skipped for translation)
  → concurrent-call guard (AtomicBoolean — skip if previous call still running)
  → thermal throttle (ThermalThrottle.Reduced doubles the interval when device is hot)
  → LlmRepository.generateInsight(prompt, systemPrompt, maxTokens)
  → LlamaAndroidDataSource → InferenceEngine (JNI) → ai_chat.cpp
  → token stream → JSON parse → LlmInsight (title, summary, action_items)
  → Room DB persistence
```

**Translation mode** sends raw text only — adding a "Context/Analyze" wrapper causes small
models to echo the wrapper keywords instead of translating.

### llama.cpp Optimizations (native layer — `ai_chat.cpp`)

`libai-chat.so` is compiled from C++ source on every build (CMake, `externalNativeBuild`).
The prebuilt `.so` was removed in commit `2380ef7`; always run `./gradlew assembleDebug` after
changing any C++ parameter to pick up the new binary.

| Optimization | Value / Setting | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Context size | 4096 tokens | Covers worst-case LONG_MEETING (~3968 tokens) while halving KV cache memory vs 8192 |
| Flash attention | `auto` (llama.cpp default) | llama.cpp enables FA automatically for Gemma3 on ARM; no explicit override needed |
| KV cache precision | `f16` (default) | Full-precision keys and values; Q8\_0 quantization was tested and reverted due to measurable quality degradation on structured JSON output |
| Batch / micro-batch size | `n_batch = n_ubatch = 512` | Matches original prebuilt behaviour; provides best throughput for typical prompt lengths |
| Thread count | `clamp(hint, 2, 4)`; hint=-1 (auto) or 2 (conservative) | `checkAndCacheMemoryConstraint()` sets hint=2 after detecting RAM pressure; persisted in DataStore. Complementary `isLargeContext()` proactively enables 2 threads for large inputs |
| Sampler temperature | 0.3 | Low temperature for deterministic, structured JSON output |
| KV cache reuse | system-prompt hash comparison | Unchanged system prompt reuses the encoded prefix; only user+assistant tokens are evicted between calls |
| Context shifting | discard older half after `system_prompt_position` | Prevents hard context overflow for very long sessions |
| Single-threaded dispatcher | `Dispatchers.Default.limitedParallelism(1)` | llama.cpp is not thread-safe; all JNI calls are serialized on one coroutine thread |
| Error-state recovery | `cleanUp()` before reload | Resets internal state after an `Error` (e.g. OOM) so the next `loadModel` succeeds |
| **Adaptive unload between inferences** | `availMem < threshold × 3` (Long Meeting only) | Model freed after each inference when RAM is constrained; reloaded before the next one. Prevents kswapd from reclaiming mmap-ed pages during the 5–15 min idle gap (1000+ faults → ANR). Batch processing never frees between chunks |

### Token Budgets per Mode

| Mode | `maxTokens` |
|---|---|
| Simple Listening | 512 |
| Short Meeting | 600 |
| Long Meeting | 768 |
| Real-Time Translation | 256 |

Token budget flows from `SyncSttLlmUseCase` → `LlmRepository` → `LlamaAndroidDataSource`
→ native `processUserPrompt(n_predict)` → stops `generateNextToken()` at `stop_generation_position`.

### Inference Scheduling

| Guard | Mechanism | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Min new words | 5 words (configurable) | Skips near-empty intervals; avoids wasting a 2–8 s inference on a single word |
| Concurrent-call guard | `AtomicBoolean isLlmBusy` | If previous inference is still running when the timer fires, the interval is skipped entirely |
| Thermal throttle | `ThermalThrottle` flow | Multiplies the inference interval by 1.5× when the device reaches `THERMAL_STATUS_SEVERE`, protecting battery |
| Memory pressure | `availMem < memInfo.threshold × 3` | Adaptive threshold anchored to Android's own low-memory level for the device (~150–250 MB); multiplier of 3 gives ~450–750 MB floor — frees the LLM proactively before kswapd starts reclaiming its pages |

### Indicative Targets

- STT latency: < 200 ms per segment (Snapdragon 888)
- LLM inference: 2–8 s per insight (varies by chip and mode)
- Memory footprint: < 800 MB active (STT + LLM loaded)

## Build & Run

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
| Android Studio | Iguana (2023.2.1) or later |
| JDK | 17 |
| Android SDK | compile / target **35**, min **30** |
| Android NDK | **r29** (`29.0.13113456`) |
| CMake | 3.31+ (installed via SDK Manager) |
| Git LFS | any recent version |

> **Physical device strongly recommended** — emulator audio capture is unreliable.
> ~1.7 GB of free device storage is required for both AI models.

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Install Git LFS (once per machine)
git lfs install

# 2. Clone (LFS objects are downloaded automatically)
git clone https://github.com/Helldez/HearoPilot-App.git
cd HearoPilot-App

# 3. Configure Firebase
#    Copy the example file and fill in your own Firebase project credentials.
#    See: https://console.firebase.google.com → Project Settings → google-services.json
cp app/google-services.json.example app/google-services.json
# Then edit app/google-services.json with your actual values.

# 4. Build debug APK
./gradlew.bat assembleDebug        # Windows
./gradlew assembleDebug            # Linux / macOS

# 5. Install on device
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

> **Note — Firebase is optional for local development.** Analytics and Crashlytics are only
> active in release builds. The debug build will compile and run without a real Firebase project
> as long as `app/google-services.json` exists (the example file is sufficient).

### First Run

1. Complete the onboarding flow
2. Download the STT model (~670 MB) — required to record
3. Optionally download the LLM model — the app recommends Q8\_0 (~1 GB) or IQ4\_NL (~650 MB)
   based on your device; both variants can be downloaded from Settings at any time
4. Grant `RECORD_AUDIO` permission when prompted
5. Tap **+** to create a session, select a recording mode, and press the FAB to start

## Localization

Supported locales (25): `en`, `bg`, `cs`, `da`, `de`, `el`, `es`, `et`, `fi`, `fr`, `hr`, `hu`,
`it`, `lt`, `lv`, `mt`, `nl`, `pl`, `pt`, `ro`, `ru`, `sk`, `sl`, `sv`, `uk`

Every locale file contains fully translated UI strings **and** LLM system prompts. JSON field
names (`"title"`, `"summary"`, `"action_items"`) remain in English across all locales to ensure
consistent JSON parsing.

---

## Troubleshooting

**App crashes on launch**
→ Check that `RECORD_AUDIO` permission is granted
→ Run `./gradlew.bat clean assembleDebug` and verify zero errors

**STT produces no output**
→ Confirm the STT model is downloaded (check Settings)
→ Test on a physical device — emulator audio capture is unreliable
→ `adb logcat | grep SherpaOnnx`

**AI Insights not generated**
→ Confirm the LLM model is downloaded
→ Device needs ~1.5 GB free RAM with the LLM model loaded
→ Check the status chip in the TopBar shows "Ready"
→ `adb logcat | grep "LlamaAndroid\|SyncSttLlm"`

**Download stuck or slow**
→ Downloads resume from where they stopped — just retry
→ Ensure stable Wi-Fi; models are large (STT ~670 MB, LLM ~1 GB)

**Transcription inaccurate**
→ Speak clearly at ~30 cm from the microphone
→ Reduce background noise
→ Do **not** use `VOICE_RECOGNITION` audio source (OnePlus HAL issue)
